Calculate the following probabilities.\n\nA club\nA black card\nA 10\nA red 10\nA face card (J, Q, or K)\nAn ace\nA card that is a spade or a heart or a diamond? What is the probability of the complement event?\n\n\n\nFirst recall that a standard deck of playing cards has 4 suits: clubs (), spades (), hearts (), and diamonds (). Each suit has 13 ranks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A.\nSince there are 52 cards, the sample space has a size of 52.\na. There are 13 clubs in the deck, so it probability is \\[\n  P(A) = \\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\] b. Since half of the cards in the deck are black (all the clubs and spades), there are \\(13 \\times 2 = 26\\) black cards. \\[\n  P(B) = \\frac{26}{52} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\] c. Each suit has a 10, so there are 4 cards that are 10s. \\[\n  P(C) = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\n\\] d. There are two red 10s (10 of  and 10 of ), so \\[\n  P(D) = \\frac{2}{52} = \\frac{1}{26}\n\\] e. Each suit has a J, a Q, and a K, so there are a total of \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) face cards in the deck. \\[\n  P(E) = \\frac{12}{52} = \\frac{3}{13}\n\\] f. Each suit has an ace, so there are a total of 4 aces in the deck. \\[\n  P(F) = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\n\\] g. Each of , , and  has 13 cards. There are a total of \\(13 \\times 3 = 39\\) cards. Thus the probability of drawing one card that is , , or  is \\[\n  P(G) = \\frac{39}{52} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\] The complement of \\(G\\) is simply drawing a , so \\[\n  P(G^\\complement) = 1 - P(G) = 1 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 6.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nThe following contingency (or two-way) table summarizes results from a fictitious survey that asked about political party affiliation and who they supported in the 2024 Presidential Election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrat\nRepublican\nOther\nTotal\n\n\nHarris\n502\n224\n204\n930\n\n\nTrump\n209\n524\n312\n1045\n\n\nOther\n110\n412\n305\n827\n\n\nTotal\n821\n1160\n821\n2802\n\n\n\n\nComplete the contingency table.\nWhat is the probability of a randomly selected person who is a Democrat?\nWhat is the probability of a randomly selected person who voted for Trump?\nWhat is the probability that a person is Democrat and a Harris voter?\nWhat is the probability that a voter is either a Democrat or a Republican?\nWhat is the probability that a person is either a Republican or a Trump voter?\nWhich of these events are mutually exclusive?\n\n\n\nDenote: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  D &= \\text{event that a voter is a Democrat},\\\\\n  R &= \\text{event that a voter is a Republican},\\\\\n  H &= \\text{event that a voter voted for Harris},\\\\\n  T &= \\text{event that a voter voted for Trump}\n\\end{align}\n\\] b. There are a total of 821 Democrats, so \\[\n  P(D) = \\frac{821}{2802}\n\\] c. There are a total of 1045 Trump voters, so \\[\n  P(T) = \\frac{1045}{2802}\n\\] d. There are 502 Democrats who voted for Harris, so \\[\n  P(H) = \\frac{502}{2802}\n\\] e. There are 821 Democrats and 1160 Republicans in total, so \\[\n  P(D \\text{ and } R) = \\frac{821 + 1160}{2802} = \\frac{1981}{2802}\n\\] f. There are 1160 Republicans and 524 of those voted for Trump, but these two events are not mutually exclusive, because a voter can be both a Republican and voted for Trump. So \\[\n  P(R \\text{ or } T) = P(R) + P(T) - P(R \\text{ and } T) = \\frac{1160}{2802} + \\frac{1045}{2802} - \\frac{524}{2802} = \\frac{1681}{2802}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 7.\n\n\n\n\nQuestionAnswer\n\n\nMany AP Exams consist of multiple-choice questions with five options.\n\nWhat is the probability of guessing correctly on one question?
